### Description:


This is a personal passion project I started when I learned that there was such a thing as a keystroke listener (like the CIA kind).  I thought it would be cool to make one.  

> So why not just use an ```<form>``` and ```<input>``` tag?
> **BECAUSE ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE.** 
> I needed to make one where I did most of the heavy lifting.  So I studied and discovered what EventListeners are in JavaScript.  
> I also had to figure out what type of events were returned and how to filter out keys I didn't want > to be displayed (like when you press the spacebar > it would type 'space').  

The original version accomplished the following:

- [x] Use of Javascript ```keydown``` and ```keyup``` listeners.
- [x] DOM manipulation with ```document.addEventListener()``` and ```window.addEventListener```; 
- [x] ```.push()```
- [x] ```.splice()```

I then came in and refactored it and added the following:

ðŸ†• Using spread operators to split a string into an array of letters.

ðŸ†• combining ```setInterval()``` and ```clearInterval()``` and a for loop to create a typing effect

ðŸ†• use of ```new Promise()``` and ```resolve```

ðŸ†• Use of ```mouseenter``` event listeners to create a pop-up animation

ðŸ†• Use of clear, reusable functional programming
