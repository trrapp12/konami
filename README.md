### Description:


This is a personal passion project I started when I learned that there was such a thing as a key listener.  Obviously this isn't a full-blown one, but if figured if I could find a way to display everything that was typed on a screen it would be a harmless was to practice listening for key events and managing the information gained from them.  

- [x] Use of Javascript keydown and keyup listeners.
- [x] DOM manipulation with ```document.addEventListener()``` and ```window.addEventListener```; 
- [x] ```.push()```
- [x] ```.splice()```

ðŸ†• Using spread operators to split a string into an array of letters.

ðŸ†• combining ```setInterval()``` and ```clearInterval()``` and a for loop to create a typing effect

ðŸ†• use of ```new Promise()``` and ```resolve```

ðŸ†• Use of ```mouseenter``` event listeners to create a pop-up animation
