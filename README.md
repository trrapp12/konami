### Description:
---

This is a personal passion project I started to challenge myself to learn how to connect to an API.  The original v1.0 demonstrates the following:

- [x] Use of vanilla JavaScript to connect to an API.
- [x] ```JSON.parse().```
- [x] Iterating through a JS object.
- [x] Use of ```Math.floor()``` and ```Math.random()``` to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
- [x] Use of ```querySelector()``` and ```querySelectorAll()```.
- [x] Use of template literals `` ` ``  and placeholders `&{}`.

### Instructions on how to launch:
---

1. Create a Folder to hold the program
 > - in the terminal type `mkdir NASA_Photo_Get_Request` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
 > - navigate into the folder by typing `cd NASA_Photo_Get_Request`
 > - clone the program into the "NASA_Photo_Get_Request" folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/trrapp12/Nasa_Photo_Get_Request.git
 ```
  <br/>
  
2. Make sure you are still in the NASA_Photo_Get_Request folder.
 <br/>
 
3. From the NASA_Photo_Get_Request folder, on the terminal, type `cd NASA_Photo_Get_Request`. 
<br/>

4. Type `start index.html` to run the program from the terminal. 
<br/>

5. Click on the button to make a GET request and see the information populate below!

### Next Steps for my v.2.0:
---
- [ ] Learning how to secure the API key according to reasonable industry security measures while still allowing the project to be accessible.
- [ ] Create functions to iterate through the objects and pull out the information from the object.
- [ ] Display photos and information in a better UX/UI experience.
- [ ] integrate React.JS to create use MVC to create templates for all the information.
