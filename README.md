### Description:


This is a personal passion project I started when I learned that there was such a thing as a key listener.  Obviously this isn't a full-blown one, but if figured if I could find a way to display everything that was typed on a screen it would be a harmless was to practice listening for key events and managing the information gained from them.  

- [x] Use of Javascript keydown and keyup listeners.
- [x] DOM manipulation with ```document.addEventListener()``` and ```window.addEventListener```; 
- [x] ```.push()```
- [x] ```.splice()```
- [x] Using spread operators to split a string into an array of letters.
- [x] combining ```setInterval()``` and ```clearInterval()``` and a for loop to create a typing effect
- [x] use of ```new Promise()``` and ```resolve```
- [x] Use of ```mouseenter``` event listeners to create a pop-up animation

### Instructions on how to launch:


1. Create a Folder to hold the program
 > - in the terminal type `mkdir konami` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
 > - navigate into the folder by typing `cd konami`
 > - clone the program into the "Konami" folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/trrapp12-ironyard/konami.git
 ```
  
2. Make sure you are still in the Konami folder.
 
3. From the NASA_Photo_Get_Request folder, on the terminal, type `cd konami`. 

4. Type `start index.html` to run the program from the terminal. 

5. Type in different combinations to letters and characters to see if you can guess the secret!

### Next Steps for my v.2.0:

- [ ] Integrate a cool parallax JS library with the All Seeing Eye in the background
- [ ] Or integrate a cool effect where it looks like a hacker typing code in the background
- [ ] Make the CSS generally more stunning
- [ ] Create a feature where if you hit the delete button it deletes the character on the display
