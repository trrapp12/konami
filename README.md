### DESCRIPTION:

> “Oh, that? I never thought it was eavesdropping, Aslan. Wasn't it magic?"
>
> "Spying on people by magic is the same as spying on them in any other way.”
> 
> ― C. S. Lewis

*This is a personal passion project I started when I learned that there was such a thing as a keystroke listener (like the CIA kind).  I thought it would be cool to make one.*

*To make one it had to:*

* *listen to keystrokes*
* *do some type of logical process to check for a pattern in the keystrokes*
* *create a fun result when that pattern is found*
* *do it without an html form or input element which already has most of this baked into it (what good is experimenting with a solution that is already solved for me?)*

### THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES:

v1.0 demonstrated the following:

- [X] event listeners.
      
- [X] DOM manipulation with ```document.addEventListener()``` and ```window.addEventListener```; 

- [X]  ```.push()```

- [X] ```.splice()```

I later came back and revamped the project and included: 

🆕 Using spread operators to split a string into an array of letters.

🆕 combining ```setInterval()``` and ```clearInterval()``` and a for loop to create a typing effect

🆕 use of ```new Promise()``` and ```resolve```

🆕 Use of ```mouseenter``` event listeners to create a pop-up animation

🆕 Use of clear, reusable functional programming

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME

- [X] figuring out how keystrokes were referred to so I could ignore unimportant ones
      
- [X] Creating a typing effect, but with multiple lines.  I had to break the text up into sections and then time them correctly with setIntervals.  Looking at it now I think I can find a better way, but I also have other, more pressing, projects.
